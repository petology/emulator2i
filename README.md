```

## Build

The project can be built using `cargo`. You can also use one of the [binaries]
provided for convenience.

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Note that you need at least rust 1.15.0. Use [`rustup`] on windows or if the
packages of your distribution are too old.

## Usage

You can specify the filename of the program you want to load as a parameter on
the command line:

```sh
./2i-emulator doc/examples/answer.2i
```

Or use the built-in `load` command:

```sh
./2i-emulator
> load doc/examples/answer.2i
```

You can also generate LaTeX documents for your `2i`-programs:

```sh
./2i-emulator latex --autor "Erika Mustermann" answer.2i multiply.2i
```

See `./2i-emulator --help` for more details.

## Example

The following example (`answer.2i`) calculates the number `42` and writes it
to the output register `FE`.

```
# The answer to everything: (FE) = 42

00000: 00 00001 | 00 | 000 0101 01 | 01 1100 0
00001: 11 00010 | 00 | 000 0000 01 | 00 0100 0
00010: 00 00001 | 00 | 000 0000 01 | 00 0101 0
00011: 00 00100 | 00 | 000 0000 01 | 00 1000 0
00100: 00 00101 | 00 | 000 0000 01 | 00 1000 0
00101: 00 00110 | 00 | 001 1110 01 | 01 1100 0
00110: 00 00000 | 11 | 001 0000 00 | 00 1100 0
```

Any character but `0`, `1` and `:` is ignored inside commands and can be used
for formatting. Every command can optionally be prefixed with its address
followed by `:`. These must be strictly nondecreasing. Commands without an
explicit address are assinged the next one. An empty line and everything after
`#` is ignored.

## Documentation

The doc folder contains a german documentation of the micro computer and its
instructions. The [api documentation] of the emulator can be generated using
`cargo doc`.
